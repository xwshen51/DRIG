# Distributional Robustness via Invariant Gradients (DRIG)

This repository contains the code for the method *Distributional Robustness via Invariant Gradients (DRIG)* from the paper "[*Causality-oriented robustness: exploiting general additive interventions*]()" by Xinwei Shen, Peter BÃ¼hlmann, and Armeen Taeb (2023).

Below is a visual illustration of causality-oriented robustness a trade-off between in-distribution prediction and causality using our method DRIG that exploits general additive interventions in the data. DRIG encompasses anchor regression as a special case with mean shifts only. Our extended proposal DRIG-A provides a more flexible robustness framework.

### Instructions

`estimate.py` contains functions to obatin various estimators, including DRIG, DRIG-A, observational and pooled OLS estimators, and anchor regression.
